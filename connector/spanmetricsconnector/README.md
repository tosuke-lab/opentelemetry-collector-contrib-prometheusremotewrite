## Overview

Aggregates Request, Error and Duration (R.E.D) OpenTelemetry metrics from span data.

**Request** counts are computed as the number of spans seen per unique set of
dimensions, including Errors. Multiple metrics can be aggregated if, for instance,
a user wishes to view call counts just on `service.name` and `span.name`.

**Error** counts are computed from the Request counts which have an `Error` Status Code metric dimension.

**Duration** is computed from the difference between the span start and end times and inserted into the
relevant latency histogram time bucket for each unique set dimensions.

Each metric will have _at least_ the following dimensions because they are common
across all spans:

- `service.name`
- `span.name`
- `span.kind`
- `status.code`

## Configurations

If you are not already familiar with connectors, you may find it helpful to first
visit the [Connectors README].

The following settings can be optionally configured:

- `histogram` (default: `explicit_buckets`): Use to configure the type of histogram to record
  calculated from spans latency measurements.
  - `explicit`:
    - `buckets`: the list of durations defining the latency histogram buckets. Default
      buckets: `[2ms, 4ms, 6ms, 8ms, 10ms, 50ms, 100ms, 200ms, 400ms, 800ms, 1s, 1400ms, 2s, 5s, 10s, 15s]`
  - `exponential`:
    - `max_size` (default: 160) the maximum number of buckets per positive or negative number range.
- `latency_histogram_buckets` (deprecated): the list of durations defining the latency histogram buckets.
  - Default: `[2ms, 4ms, 6ms, 8ms, 10ms, 50ms, 100ms, 200ms, 400ms, 800ms, 1s, 1400ms, 2s, 5s, 10s, 15s]`
- `dimensions`: the list of dimensions to add together with the default dimensions defined above.
  
  Each additional dimension is defined with a `name` which is looked up in the span's collection of attributes or
  resource attributes (AKA process tags) such as `ip`, `host.name` or `region`.
  
  If the `name`d attribute is missing in the span, the optional provided `default` is used.
  
  If no `default` is provided, this dimension will be **omitted** from the metric.
- `dimensions_cache_size`: the max items number of `metric_key_to_dimensions_cache`. If not provided, will
  use default value size `1000`.
- `aggregation_temporality`: Defines the aggregation temporality of the generated metrics. 
  One of either `AGGREGATION_TEMPORALITY_CUMULATIVE` or `AGGREGATION_TEMPORALITY_DELTA`.
  - Default: `AGGREGATION_TEMPORALITY_CUMULATIVE`
- `namespace`: Defines the namespace of the generated metrics. If `namespace` provided, generated metric name will be added `namespace.` prefix.

## Examples

The following is a simple example usage of the `spanmetrics` connector.
