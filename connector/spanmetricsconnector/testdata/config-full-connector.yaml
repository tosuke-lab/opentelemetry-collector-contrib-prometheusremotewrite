      # If the span is missing http.method, the connector will insert
      # the http.method dimension with value 'GET'.
      # For example, in the following scenario, http.method is not present in a span and so will be added as a dimension to the metric with value "GET":
      # - calls_total{http_method="GET",span_name="/Address",service_name="shippingservice",span_kind="SPAN_KIND_SERVER",status_code="STATUS_CODE_UNSET"} 1
      - name: http.method
        default: GET

      # If a default is not provided, the http.status_code dimension will be omitted
      # if the span does not contain http.status_code.
      # For example, consider a scenario with two spans, one span having http.status_code=200 and another missing http.status_code. Two metrics would result with this configuration, one with the http_status_code omitted and the other included:
      # - calls_total{http_status_code="200",span_name="/Address",service_name="shippingservice",span_kind="SPAN_KIND_SERVER",status_code="STATUS_CODE_UNSET"} 1
      # - calls_total{span_name="/Address",service_name="shippingservice",span_kind="SPAN_KIND_SERVER",status_code="STATUS_CODE_UNSET"} 1
      - name: http.status_code
